# Challenge-6-weather

I am creating a weather app that is based around server side APIs.
I am using an API from openweathermap.org that was provided to me by the bootcamp program. I couldn't get the api key to work and I didn't do much with the JS or CSS. Will come back to work on if I find the time.

These are the requirements that need to be met:

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
